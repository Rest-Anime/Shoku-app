Final graduation project. It's an android application with calls to a non-relational database (firebase).
It consists of a main page where you can see all the 'animes' that are in the database with their descriptions, scores, episodes; you can also filter by favorite lists, modify the user and see all users.

We stopped developing the app once we graduated.
